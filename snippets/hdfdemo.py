        In this example

        1. We create a passive neuronal compartment `comp`.

        2. We create an HDF5DataWriter object `hdfwriter` for writing to a
           file ``output_hdfdemo.h5``.  The `mode` of the HDF5DataWriter
           is set to `2` which means if a file of the same name exists, it
           will be overwritten.

        3. The membrane voltage `Vm` and membrane current `Im` of `comp`
           are connected to `hdfwriter` for recording.

        4. We set some attributes of the datasets and the file.

        5. We run the simulation, `hdfwriter` records and stores the `Vm`
           and `Im` values over time.

        6. We close the file by calling close() method of `hdfwriter`.

        Running this snippet creates the file ``output_hdfdemo.h5`` which
        reflects the structure of the model::

          model
            |
            |
            c[0]
            |
            |___im
            |
            |___vm


        `im` and `vm` are datasets containing `Im` and `Vm` field values
        recorded from `comp`.
