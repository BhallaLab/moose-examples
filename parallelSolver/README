Parallel solvers are implemented for Ksolve, Dsolve and Gsolve.

Instructions to run the solvers in parallel. 

1) Clone the repository from github/BhallaLab/moose-core/tree/multithreaded 
   i.e., the multithreaded branch of the moose-core. 

2) Build the code, compile and run it.

3) Set the environment variable NUM_THREADS to the number of threads with which you want to execute your script. 

4) The environment variable has to be set to make use of the parallelization. It runs with 1 thread by default(sequential). 

3) Run your python script regularly. The framwork will pick up the number of threads set by you and parallelize the solvers using them.
