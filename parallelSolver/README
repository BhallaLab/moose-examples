Parallel solvers are implemented for Ksolve, Dsolve and Gsolve.

Instructions to run the solvers in parallel. 

1) Set the environment variable NUM_THREADS to the number of threads with which you want to execute your script. 
2) The environment variable has to be set (mandatory). 
3) Run your python script regularly. The framwork will pick up the number of threads set by you and parallelize the solvers using them.
